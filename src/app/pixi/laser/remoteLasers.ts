/**
 * Other people's lasers as messages bring them: each a trail that fades like Atlas's own, its
 * newest point held at full strength until the laser is let go. A laser that hears nothing for
 * a second is let go, so a lost lift never leaves one hanging. Shared by the GM's view
 * (`RemoteLaserRenderer`) and the join page.
 *
 * Messages arrive in bursts, unevenly. So a laser is played back, not drawn on arrival: its
 * points keep the spacing in time they were drawn with (the sender's `dt`, or an even spread
 * over one send interval without), the whole stroke runs `LASER_PLAYBACK_DELAY_MS` behind the
 * messages, and the head glides between points. A burst that is later than that delay moves the
 * stroke back a little instead of stalling it. Each trail point fades from its own time.
